### EPAM Python course

This repository was created for homeworks solutions. This repository contains directories each of which has homework for corresponding week.

Course source contains more extra information, it is here: [course](https://github.com/cdeler/epam_python_autumn_2020)

For every homework exists tests, so you can run them this way `pytest tests/`

Every homework was formatted by: `isort` and `black` formatters <br/>
You can install formatters by basic python installer `pip`:
`pip install isort`, `pip install black`. <br/>

Also you can run it:
 - just file `isort filename.py`, `black filename.py`
 - recursively for current directory: `isort .`, `black .`

Environment: python3.8

Special thanks to @apaniukov for reviewing my Homeworks and answering for my silly questions
